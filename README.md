<h1 align='center'>My Design Principles</h1>

I was tasked to come up with a product design for a website interface that will serve both it's mobile and desktop users, in my design research process and after having a clear communication with the team, I was given refrences and had to come up with my own ideas on how to improve these refrences to better suit our ultimate design goal. 

**Mobile and Web Responsive**: first, the website had to be responsive due to persistent increase in users accessing the internet through their mobile phones over desktops or laptops devices, so this website had to be responsive which enables it to be accessible on any type screen size or device, the website is able to switch on having a sidebar on desktops or large screens to having a native-app-like footer navigation on mobile or smaller screens.

**User-oriented interface**: the product was built to be user focused as to make it's users feel at home when utilizing the website and knowing that they are in full control of their smart-home and devices, this user name is displayed on logging in into the website, thier dashboard is filled with usefull weather informations such as Current Weather, Wind force, Temprature and Pressure.

It also show the available devices paired and detected by the grandeurSmart system, it displays rooms where those devices belong on the user dashboard to help in easily navigating areas where these devices have been categorized to. 

**CRUD (Create, Read, Delete, Update)**: One of my design principles was to make the user interface very interactive by addind CRUD feautures to the front-end, on the grandeurSmart platform user can **Create** rooms, persons (sub-accounts) 

**Light and Dark Mode**:

**installability (iOs, Android or Desktop)**:
